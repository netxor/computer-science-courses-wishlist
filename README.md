# My Wishlist of Computer Science courses to complete one day

It's recommended to learn in the order presented below. The list of courses has been mainly taken from https://teachyourselfcs.com/ and added some extra courses and links by me.

## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

There's a book called SICP and also video lectures that were filmed in MIT in the year of approximately 1987.

Book is here: (Translated into multiple languages including Russian).

MIT 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming, Fall 2008 (Prof. Eric Grimson, John Guttag): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM&list=PL4C4720A6F225E074

How to Design Programs (HtDP): https://htdp.org/

Notes: You can use Clojure programming language instead of Scheme, which has been used in SICP course. Scheme is a dialect of LISP as well as Clojure. However, Clojure is more modern and useful to learn at the same time. But still Scheme is okay if you prefer not to switch to any another lagnuage.
